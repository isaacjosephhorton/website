In today's digital age, having an online presence is essential for professionals, including designers and photographers. Whether you're looking to showcase your work or build a brand, a website is an excellent way to reach your target audience. However, building a website from scratch can be a daunting task, especially if you don't have any coding experience.

This is where static site generators come in handy. They allow you to create a website quickly and easily without writing any code. One such generator is Miniml, designed for ease of use and flexibility for building basic sites, especially portfolios for designers and photographers that can be hosted for free on Github.

What is Miniml?

Miniml is a static site generator written in Python. It takes a directory of files written in Markdown and converts them into a website. The resulting website consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which can be hosted on any web server. Github Pages is a popular option for hosting static websites for free, and Miniml is designed to work seamlessly with it.

2. Flexibility: Miniml is flexible enough to accommodate different types of content, including text, images, videos, and more. You can also customize the look and feel of your website by editing the CSS and JavaScript files.
3. Fast: Since Miniml generates static HTML files, your website will load quickly, even on slow internet connections.
4. Cost-effective: Github Pages is free to use for hosting static websites, making it an excellent option for those on a budget.
